# wevi

**Webview library bindings for Zig.**

Wevi is intended to be a high-level abstraction for cross-platform webview integration. Along with abstraction, Wevi exposes underlying API bindings for more custom-tailored functionality.

## Platform Support

As of now, Wevi supports 64-bit **Windows and MacOS** (Apple silicon). Please create an issue if you need other platform support for your use case.

## Dependency

All of Wevi's dependencies are linked as static libraries on MacOS. No additional steps are required!

On Windows, `webview.dll` is required on the final executable. You will find the necessary steps in the **Installation** section in the documentation.
