**Webview Library Binding**

Wevi is intended to be a high-level abstraction for cross-platform webview integration. Along with abstraction, Wevi exposes underlying API bindings for more custom-tailored functionality.

The underlying API bindings are implemented on a need-per-basis. If you need other platform support or API code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Wevi Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-bolt/wevi) and buy us some coffee.
